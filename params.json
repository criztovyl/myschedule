{"name":"mySchedule","tagline":"Script to directly go to your schedule","body":"#MySchedule\r\nThis is an script, that enables you to go directly to your schedule from your schedule manager's welcome page.\r\n\r\n#Requirements\r\nThis application requires Greasemonkey and currently only available for Mozilla Firefox. \r\n\r\nHow to install requirements is shown in \"Prerequisites\" below.\r\n\r\n#Prerequisites\r\nTo install the Mozilla Firefox go to [Firefox Download Page](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and follow the installer's instructions.\r\n\r\nTo install Greasemonkey, go to it's [Addon Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and add it to Firefox.\r\n\r\n#Install\r\nTo install the script, click [here](myschedule.user.js) or open the `myschedule.user.js` with your Firefox. Greasemonky will ask you if you want to install the script, click install, if you want to ;)\r\n\r\nThen you are ready to go :)\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nGo to your schedule manager's page. You will see a new text line, that wasn't there before, calling \"Not set, please set schedule first.\". For the first usage, thats okay.\r\n\r\nAs next choose your schedule and press the \"Set\" Button below the schedule table. There should be an alert \"Set your schedule to c1\", where c1 is the id of your schedule.\r\n\r\nNext time you visit the page, you will see a \"My Schedule\" button instead of the text. Click on it and it will display your schedule, set before. The schedule id is saved via an cookie, so you should allow your schedule manager's cookies, if you have configured to delete cookies or so.\r\n\r\nYou also can go directly to your schedule if you add `#myschedule` to the URL, than you don't need to click on the button.\r\n\r\n#Meta\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nI've written this because it was exhausting search the schedule every time. And because I wanted to try GreaseMonkey :)\r\n\r\n##Problems\r\nA problem was to get the Week of Year of an date but I've found an [solution on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6117889)(the minified prototype). The schedule manager's page is made with frames, so the way dealing with getting and setting the (frame) window location is different.\r\n\r\n##ToDo\r\n\r\n * Add \"show welcome page\"\r\n * Make code object-orientated.\r\n\r\n##Changelog\r\nSee [commits](https://github.com/criztovyl/myschedule/commits/master).\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
